## App Description:
This is a node.js application deployed on a Heroku web server that allows users to track their workouts, exercises, create new workouts, and add new exercises. 

## Methodology:
This node.js app relies on 3 key node packages: Express, Mongoose, and Morgan. Utilizing these 3 main node dependencies we are able to connect to MongoDB as the database for storing our exercises, workouts, and different exercise types (resistance or cardio). This application is deployed on a Heroku web server and utilizes MongoDB Atlas to render the database online.
